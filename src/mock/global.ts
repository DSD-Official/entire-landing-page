      "A: Once you own a DDog NFT, you gain access to the protocol. The protocol allows you to stake your NFT to earn $EBONE, the gaming token that will let you play games and determine player rankings. This protocol is a DAO, which means there is no central authority. The power will be distributed to DDog owners who can vote on the protocol’s direction.",

You can’t buy more $EBONE and there’s no IDO or token unlock - 100% fair emissions rewards. Even the founders have to buy an NFT and stake to earn. Those who are risk tolerant can try to expand their $EBONE bag by betting on Crash, poker or, in the future, DDog racing.

Our Crash game is different because you can play without betting crypto; you simply wager your $EBONE rewards through NFT staking. Of course you can wager crypto too if you are risk tolerant. Our protocol has about a 3-4% instant Crash rate which is in-line with other Crash games and our max payout is 5000 USDT per game, which is subject to increase once our treasury expands through user engagement",

    content:
      "A: We are a group of Devs who love crypto, gaming and poker. We wanted to initially build on MultiversX because of the strength of community, speed and security, but our protocol will ultimately be blockchain agnostic. Our goal is to build a secure, fair and fun gaming hub where Web3 enthusiasts can socialize and play games of chance and skill. We want the protocol to be self-sustaining and community-led.

      "A: We want to create a Web3 social gaming hub where players can enjoy competitive games based on skill and chance. We think blockchain technology provides certain advantages to fair and secure gaming that traditional sites lack. A casino is a centralized entity with a statistical edge against players who are trying to ‘beat the house.’ Our protocol fees are programmed to go back to DDog holders each week in the form of rewards so you aren’t playing against a house. We are taking a part of the fees to keep the lights on and using NFT sales to fund ongoing game development",
